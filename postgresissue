Open the terminal on your Linux system.
You will need to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file or add a new file in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory. It's generally recommended to add a new file for repository additions to keep customizations separate from the main sources.list file. You can use any text editor you prefer, such as nano or vim. Here, I'll use nano for simplicity:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list
In the editor, add the following line:
bash
Copy code
deb https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ bionic-pgdg main
This line specifies the repository to use for PostgreSQL packages.

Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing CTRL + O, hitting Enter, and then CTRL + X to exit.

After adding the repository, update the package lists to include the new repository's packages:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
